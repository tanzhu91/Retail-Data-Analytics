First thing we notice is the high amount of sales around 26th ov November and 30 and 23-24 th December. While November 26 th is an official holiday in the United States 23rd of December is not but it is Christmas time so the high amount of sales the week before that makes sense.

Here we can see which days are officially holidays in the data. The week before December 31 st, there is huge drop in sales despite it being a holiday , suggesting a pattern of avoiding purchases by customers right before the new year.

In this figure we can see the sales across departments and all 3 years. We can already see that some departments make much bigger share of the sales like number 92 , 95 , 38 , 72 , 40 and 2.

There was some really bad performing departmens in the data. The suprising thing was there is even one with negative amount of sales. Something mysterious is happening in Department 47.

Here Weekly sales are plotted against type of stores and amount of sales based on holiday or not.

I decided to plot the stores of the best performing department based on sales and the worst one. We can see that department 92 has best performing stores numbered as follows: 14,2,20,13,4 and so on. The size is not always the biggest but most of them are close to the biggest possible.

Worst performers in department 47 are store number 35,1,10,45 and so on.

Here correlation between size of stores and weekly sales shows clearly there is a positive relationship. The bigger the store the more sales in total. The model is with an R value of 71 % , so it is quite good.

In this graph we can see the dates when promotional markdowns were available. A lot of them are right before holiday or around holiday times.
